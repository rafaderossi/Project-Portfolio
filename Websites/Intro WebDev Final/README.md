# Intro to Web Development Final

This website was my final project in my Intro to Web Development course and my first website that I ever created. It has its limitations because it was only an intro level course but I enjoyed it. 

## 🛠️ Built With 

- **HTML5** - for structuring the site
- **CSS3** - for styling and layout
- **JavaScript** - Simple and organized code

## 🎓 About the project

The purpose of this project was to demonstrate everything that I learned throughout my Intro to Web Dev course. I had taken courses in HTML, JavaScript, and CSS on CodeCademy and got the certs so this class was rather a breeze but I did learn things that I didn't in CodeCademy. 

## 💡 Features

- Responsive layout
- Custom CSS design
- JavaScript-based interactivity
- Simple and organized code

## 🚀 Getting Started

To view this project locally:

1. Download or clone the project folder 
2. Open index.html in your web browser

No installation or server required - it's a static site. 

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to plan and build a full web project from scratch
- Using semantic HTML and CSS for structure and style 
- Adding interactivity with JavaScript
- Organizing files and maintaining clean code
